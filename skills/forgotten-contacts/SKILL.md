# forgotten-contacts

Pull from iMessage history to find contacts you've gone quiet on. Useful for relationship maintenance.

## Stopping Point 1 — Lookback window

1. **Last 90 days quiet (top 20)** — `inactive_days: 90`, `limit: 20`
2. **Past year quiet (top 30)** — `inactive_days: 365`, `limit: 30`
3. **Quick wins (engaged before, gone quiet)** — `inactive_days: 90`, `limit: 10`, `min_messages: 25` (high-engagement contacts only)

Format the response as a short list — name + last contact date. Suggest reconnect ideas only if the user asks.
