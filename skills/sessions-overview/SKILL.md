# sessions-overview

Show what MCP sessions are currently active. Useful for debugging routing issues or seeing which servers have warm connections.

## Stopping Point 1 — Scope

1. **All sessions** — list every active session
2. **Filter by server** — pull `{{TOPIC}}` from the user's question and filter

After listing, group by server. If anything looks stuck (long idle), highlight it at the top.
