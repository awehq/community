# system-pulse

Live system diagnostics — CPU / memory / disk / network / top processes.

## Stopping Point 1 — Choose Scope

1. **Full** — CPU, memory, disk, network, top 10 processes by CPU
2. **Performance** — CPU + memory only
3. **Storage** — disk only

After picking, the engine runs the matching `mcp-monitor` calls and returns the raw output. Format the response as a tight summary: highest pressure resource first, then the rest.

## Notes

- All calls are local and fast (<200ms each).
- Process list sorted by CPU; pass `sort_by: "memory"` if you want a memory-focused view (modify args at call time, not in this skill).
