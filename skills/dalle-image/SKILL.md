# dalle-image

Generate an image using DALL-E. The user's prompt is templated as `{{TOPIC}}`.

## Stopping Point 1 — Quality

1. **Quick** — DALL-E 3, standard quality (fast, cheap)
2. **HD** — DALL-E 3, hd quality (slower, finer details)
3. **Variations (4)** — DALL-E 2 with `n: 4` for a quick concept sweep

After generation, the response includes the saved file path. Show it to the user.
