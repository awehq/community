# research-topic

Resolve a library/framework name to its canonical id, then pull docs at the requested depth. The user's library/topic is templated as `{{TOPIC}}`.

## Stopping Point 1 — Depth

1. **Quick lookup** — just resolve the library id (good for "is X documented?")
2. **Full docs** — resolve + general docs query
3. **Code examples** — resolve + targeted examples query
4. **API reference** — resolve + complete API surface query

The first step in 2/3/4 captures `LIBRARY_ID` from `resolve-library-id` and feeds it into `query-docs`.
