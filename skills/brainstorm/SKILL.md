# brainstorm

Ideation helper. The user's topic is templated as `{{TOPIC}}`.

## Stopping Point 1 — Mode

1. **Brief (3 ideas)** — concise, conventional, ready-to-use
2. **Standard (5 ideas)** — mix of safe + slightly unusual
3. **Wild (10 ideas)** — push hard for unconventional, surprising, or contrarian angles

After the response comes back, return it as a numbered list. Don't add commentary unless the user asks for a follow-up.
