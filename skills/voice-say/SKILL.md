# voice-say

Use the awe voice channel to speak the user's text. The text to speak is templated as `{{TOPIC}}`.

## Stopping Point 1 — What to do?

1. **Speak it** — `voice_speak` with the user's text
2. **List voices** — show available voices, then ask which to use next time
3. **Stop talking** — `voice_stop` cancels current playback

After speaking, return a short confirmation. If the channel isn't connected, point the user to `channel-status`.
