# calendar-quick-status

Quick read on the user's Google Calendar. Always uses the `primary` calendar unless the user names another.

## Stopping Point 1 — What do you want to see?

1. **Today** — `get-current-time` then `list-events` from now, capped at the rest of today
2. **This week** — `list-events` for the next ~7 days
3. **Next meeting only** — `list-events` with `maxResults: 1` from now
4. **Search by keyword** — `search-events` with the keyword pulled from the user's question (`{{TOPIC}}`)

## Output formatting

Format every option's response as a tight bullet list:

- `• <start time> — <event title> (<duration> or "all day")`
- Use the user's timezone from the `get-current-time` response
- Group by day if the window spans multiple days
- If the result is empty: "Nothing scheduled in <window>."

## Edge cases

- **Auth missing / 401:** Tell the user to connect Google Calendar at http://localhost:8765/#/apps and stop.
- **All-day events:** Show as "all day" instead of a time range.
- **Recurring events:** `singleEvents: true` already expands them — format normally.
